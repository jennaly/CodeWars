// You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

// Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

// Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.

const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => Number(fuelLeft) >= Number(distanceToPump)/Number(mpg)



// The code provided is supposed replace all the dots . in the specified String str with dashes -

// But it's not working properly.

// Task
// Fix the bug so we can all go home early.

// Notes
// String str will never be null.

var replaceDots = function(str) {
    return str.replace(/[.]/g, '-');
